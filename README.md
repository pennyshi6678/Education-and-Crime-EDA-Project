# Education-and-Crime-EDA
This is an Exploratory Data Analysis project on the Role of Education in Reducing Crime in Chicago. The project aims to develop a data-driven narrative to assist Chicago's leadership in reducing the city's crime rate by 25% over three years.

Here is the pdf for the [EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on Education and Crimes](https://github.com/pennyshi6678/Education-and-Crime-EDA/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(EDA)%20on%20Education%20and%20Crime%20in%20Chicago.pdf) in Chicago from 2012-2014.

Here is the presentation on the analysis of [Education's Role on Reducing Crimes in Chicago](https://github.com/pennyshi6678/Education-and-Crime-EDA/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Education%20and%20Crimes%20in%20Chicago.pdf). 

The narrative will be supported by visualizations tailored for key stakeholders:
## 1. Chief of Police and Staff:

Objective: Provide insights into crime trends, identify high-risk areas, and evaluate the effectiveness of current policing strategies.
Narrative Features:
- Visualization of citywide crime rates over time.
- Identification of the five most and five least dangerous neighborhoods.
- Analysis of crime patterns in relation to educational institutions.
- Proportion of students underperforming by race in these neighborhoods.
- Exploration of correlations between various variables, such as socioeconomic factors and crime rates.

## 2. CEO of Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and Staff:

Objective: Understand the impact of educational factors on crime rates and identify schools in high-crime areas that are performing exceptionally well.
Narrative Features:

- Visualization of student performance metrics across neighborhoods.
- Identification of schools with high performance in high-crime areas.
- Analysis of the relationship between school performance and local crime rates.
- Exploration of potential causations or correlations between education and crime.

## 3. Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Chief of Public Policy, and Chief Data Officer:

Objective: Gain a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between education and crime to inform policy decisions.
Narrative Features:

- Citywide crime rate trends with a focus on educational institutions.
- Comparative analysis of crime rates in neighborhoods with varying educational outcomes.
- Identification of schools that have contributed to crime reduction.
- Statistical analysis of the relationship between education and crime, including discussions on causation versus correlation.

By leveraging data visualization and analysis, the project seeks to provide actionable insights to these stakeholders, facilitating informed decision-making to achieve the targeted crime reduction.
